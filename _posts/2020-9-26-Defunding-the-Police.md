Defunding the police is a key demand of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite campaigning on defunding the police, Sarah's position on this varries depending on who she is talking to. While her campaign manager asserts that ["Sarah's platform called for defunding before it was a buzz word"](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKelvey/status/1304517063155675136?s=20), Sarah said in a 2019 interview that ["she never said to defund the police"](https://soundcloud.com/thelarslarsonshow/lars-speaks-with-the-activist#t=5:33).

Maybe Sarah's campaign website will help clarify her position. On the page for ["Rethinking Public Safety"](https://sarah2020.com/en/policies/rethinking-public-safety/), the word "defund" is never used.

Her [official Georgy Floyd Protests Response](https://sarah202.com/en/policies/george-floyd-protests) calls for "defunding the militarization of Portland police". This is a misleading co-option of the language of BLM demands. Defunding the *militarization* of police is not defunding the police department in general. 

BLM protests arose in response to the murder of Black people by police officers. BLM is fighting for the end to systemic injustice imposted on Black people by police officers in all its forms. "Defunding the police" addresses the murder, unlawful arrests, harassment, and racial profiling faced by Black people. Defunding the "militarization of police" does not address these issues; it only addresses the brutality displayed by police at protests. To pass this platform off as meeting the "defund the police" demand is intellectually dishonest.

While Sarah has co-opted the *language* of defunding the police, she has not adopted the *policy* of defunding the police.
