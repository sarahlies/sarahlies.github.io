Defunding the police is a key demand of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite campaigning on defunding the police, Sarah's position on this varries depending on who she is talking to. While her [campaign manager asserts that "Sarah's platform called for defunding before it was a buzz word"](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKelvey/status/1304517063155675136?s=20), [Sarah said in a 2019 interview that she never said to defund the police](https://soundcloud.com/thelarslarsonshow/lars-speaks-with-the-activist#t=5:33).

While Sarah has co-opted the *language* of defunding the police, she has not adopted the *policy* of defunding the police.
