On [Sarah's official voters' pamphlet statement](https://multco.us/file/91934/download), she is listed as having a Ph.D. (ABD). Do you know what ABD stands for? Neither did we, and neither does the average voter.

It turns out ABD stands for "all but dissertation", meaning that Sarah completed the coursework, but has not written and defended a research dissertation. The defense of a dissertation is a crucial part of obtaining a PhD, setting apart a masters' degree from a doctorate degree. If Sarah wanted to list an incomplete academic achievement in her educational background, there should have been a clear distinction that the degree was in progress. Instead, she chose to use an obscure acronym. Sarah has been hit with an [election complaint](https://www.opb.org/article/2020/09/18/mayoral-candidate-sarah-ianaronne-hit-with-election-complaint-for-phd-statement-in-voters-pamphlet/) for this issue.
