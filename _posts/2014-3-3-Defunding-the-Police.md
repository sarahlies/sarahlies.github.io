Defunding the police is a key demand of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite campaigning on defunding the police, Sarah's position on this varries depending on who she is talking to. While her campaign manager asserts that ["Sarah's platform called for defunding before it was a buzz word"](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKelvey/status/1304517063155675136?s=20), Sarah said in a 2019 interview that ["she never said to defund the police"](https://soundcloud.com/thelarslarsonshow/lars-speaks-with-the-activist#t=5:33).

Perhaps we could clear this up by checking Sarah's campaign website. On her page for ["Rethinking Public Safety"](https://sarah2020.com/en/policies/rethinking-public-safety/), the word "defund" is never used.

Her [officla Georgy Floyd Protests Response](https://sarah202.com/en/policies/george-floyd-protests) calls for "defunding the militarization of Portland police". This is a misleading co-option of the language of BLM demands. Defunding the *militarization* of police is not defunding the police department in general. The militarized brutality displayed by police at protests is only one of many issues raised about the police.

The BLM protests are in response to the murder of Black people by police officers, unlawful arrest, 

Defunding militar of police does nothing for Black people subject t

While Sarah has co-opted the *language* of defunding the police, she has not adopted the *policy* of defunding the police.
