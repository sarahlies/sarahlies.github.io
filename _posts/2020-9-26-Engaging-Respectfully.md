Sarah has a habit of villainizing her opposition by accusing them of engaging disrespectfully. While Sarah holds the tone of her opposition to the highest standard, her own surrogates have repeatadly made ableist statements and smeared the character of a Black community activist and her supporters.

- After denouncing the "toxicity" of write-in supporters, Sarah's campaign director claims that [he doesn't comment on those who are not in power](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKelvey/status/1305340064428220417). Days later, he retweeted a post saying Sarah was being ["ratfucked by a bunch of idiots promoting a write-in campaign"](https://twitter.com/CandiceAiston/status/1304919495878742016). He then liked the same user's post calling write-in supporters ["high key stupid as fuck"](https://twitter.com/CandiceAiston/status/1305387600254054400).

- When faced with community criticism for endorsing Sarah, Cameron Whitten attacked the character of write-in supporters, saying they should focus on ["organizing and building constructive relationships within the community"](https://twitter.com/CameronWhitten/status/1306385769104248832?s=20). This is a serious attack on the character of those who support one of the most constructive Black leaders in Portland. Cameron himself once called her a ["relentlessly committed" activist](https://twitter.com/CameronWhitten/status/250295694861160448).

- The point of [Sarah's disastrous Lars interview](https://soundcloud.com/thelarslarsonshow/lars-speaks-with-the-activist) was to denounce Lars for calling her a "snowflake". While Lars was engaging in bad faith, Sarah's response was to prove his point.

 When faced with criticism, you can count on Sarah and her token surrogates to play victim and turn blame onto the critic.
